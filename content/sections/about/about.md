Thanks for checking out my portfolio site!

I enjoy building full-stack web applications that provide a useful service or helpful information along with a responsive and intuitive user interface.

My favorite technologies to use when building websites are Next.js, React, Node, Typescript, Prisma, and Tailwind.

When I am not programming, I like to play video games and watch anime.
